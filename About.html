      I don't mean to brag but I have quite the list of achievements, I couldn't list them all, I'm exceedingly humble, so I wrote them in the document at the bottom. I'm an engineering student with an interest in development, music and writing. I enjoy researching new ways to save time and be more productive while I'm supposed to be working and promising myself ill change for the better tomorrow when I'm supposed to be sleeping.

I like old songs, new gadgets and enjoy watching YouTube videos that give me a crippling existential crisis. In my free time I compose music that moves people (mostly away from me). I also enjoy employing my quick wit and dry humour on my friends, which I keep needing to make more of.

This website was developed by me and the content it links to is owned and produced by me personally. If you want to contact me to use any of my articles or music I will ignore you because I know its trash.
